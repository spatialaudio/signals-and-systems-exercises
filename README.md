## Tutorial

**Continuous- and Discrete-Time Signals and Systems - A Tutorial with Computational Examples**

- https://github.com/spatialaudio/signals-and-systems-exercises

## Lecture

This Jupyter notebook based tutorial using Python is accompanying the lecture

**Continuous-Time and Discrete-Time Signals and Systems - Theory and Computational Examples**

- https://github.com/spatialaudio/signals-and-systems-lecture

Lecture and tutorial are designed for International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) level 6.


## German Distance Learning Version

We are currently designing a very detailed 12 units tutorial to support
distance learning for our students, thus the initial version is in German.
Translations to English are scheduled ASAP.

Please see the LaTex main file `tutorial_latex_deu/sig_sys_ex.tex`.
There are several graphics included, which are created by the provided
Jupyter notebooks.

We might wish to compile all notebooks at once, then we can use:

`python3 -m nbconvert --execute --inplace *.ipynb **/*.ipynb`
