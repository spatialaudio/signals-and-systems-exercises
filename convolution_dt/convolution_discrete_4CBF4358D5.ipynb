    "However, this re-insertion has no impact on the convolution result, since there is no overlap of these values with $h$.\n",
    "This is due to the initial, properly done zero padding to ensure (i) proper time alignment between $x$ and $h$ and (ii) same lengths $N=N_x+N_h-1$ of $x$, $h$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This handling is also used to perform a [fast linear convolution](https://github.com/spatialaudio/signals-and-systems-lecture/blob/master/discrete_fourier_transform/fast_convolution.ipynb) of two finite length sequences with the help of a cyclic convolution, which corresponds to a multiplication in the [DFT](https://github.com/spatialaudio/signals-and-systems-lecture/blob/master/discrete_fourier_transform/definition.ipynb)-domain.\n",
